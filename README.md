# numpy-user-dtypes

Repository for development of dtypes making use of the [NEP
42](https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0042-new-dtypes.html) extensible dtype API. See
the readme files in each example dtype for build instructions.

These dtypes are not meant for real-world use yet. The dtype API is not
finalized and the dtypes in this repository are still active works in progress.
